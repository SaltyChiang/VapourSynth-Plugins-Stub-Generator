# VapourSynth-Plugins-Stub-Generator
An unofficial stub generator for vapoursynth and its plugins, which is helpful to autocomplete code in VSCode.

## Generate the stub file

At first, you need to have a [python](https://www.python.org/) with [vapoursynth](https://www.vapoursynth.com/) installed. You can check it with
```bash
python -c 'from vapoursynth import core; print(core.version())'
```

Then run the command:
```bash
python vs_plugins_helper.py
```

A file called `vapoursynth.pyi` should be created at where you run the command. Move it to where your language server or library like Jedi can recognize.

## Install the `vapoursynth-stubs` package

Generating a stub-only package named `vapoursynth-stubs` usually helps a lot. You can install the `vsstubs` package by `pip` and then install the `*-stubs` package.

```bash
python -m pip install .\vsstubs\
python -m vsstubs install
```

All language servers in VSCode should work with such a package to autocomplete your code.

Once you have installed the stub file, you can update it if there are some new filters added to `vapoursynth` after installation.
```bash
python -m vsstubs update
```

For more usage and mode, get the help message by
```bash
python -m vsstubs help
```

## Setting up VSCode

Files in `.vscode` folder might be helpful to set up VSCode.

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then install [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) in VSCode extension market.

2. Paste the settings.json to the *user settings folder*<sup>1</sup> or *work area settings folder*<sup>2</sup>. This will enable the python code highlighting and autocompletion.

3. Paste the tasks.json to the *user settings folder*<sup>1</sup> or *work area settings folder*<sup>2</sup>, and paste the keybindings.json to your vscode *user settings folder*<sup>1</sup>. This will enable shift+f5/f6 hotkeys as f5/f6 in vsedit.

4. **Remember to change `"path\\to\\your\\VapourSynth\\python.exe"` in settings.json to your own python interpreter.**

<sup>1</sup>: Usually refer to `%APPDATA%\Code\User\` on Windows and `$HOME/.config/Code/User/` on Linux

<sup>2</sup>: Usually refer to `/path/to/your/workdir/.vscode/`
